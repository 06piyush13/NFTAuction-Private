# Midnight NFT Auction 🚀

A decentralized, privacy-preserving NFT auction platform built on the **Midnight Blockchain**. This project implements a secure sealed-bid (Vickrey-style) auction mechanism where bid amounts remain private until the reveal phase, leveraging Midnight's zero-knowledge capabilities.

*The demo covers: Midnight local network setup, Lace wallet funding, contract deployment, and end-to-end auction flow.*

## Project Description
The **Midnight NFT Auction** platform allows users to auction their NFTs in a completely secure and private manner. Unlike traditional transparent auctions, this platform uses a commit-reveal process:
1. **Auction Creation**: Sellers list their NFT with a minimum starting price.
2. **Secret Bidding**: Buyers commit to a bid amount by submitting a hash of their bid and a secret. The actual bid remains hidden from everyone, including the seller.
3. **Reveal Phase**: After the bidding period ends, buyers reveal their bids by providing the secret.
4. **Finalization**: The contract automatically determines the winner (highest bidder) and transfers the NFT while maintaining the privacy of other participants.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to bring institutional-grade privacy to the NFT market. By using Midnight's ZK-proof technology, we aim to eliminate "bid sniping" and market manipulation in high-value digital asset exchanges. We want to provide a trustless environment where the true market value of an asset can be discovered without revealing participant strategies.
